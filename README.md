This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException caused by an off-by-one error in a for loop. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `FixedArray.java` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from iterating one element past the valid index range of the array.
